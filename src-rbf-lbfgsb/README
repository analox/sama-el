Surrogate-Assisted Memetic Algorithm (using GA+L-BFGS-B) example , here with RBF model

To compile: 
**********
Just type make

To run 1 time only  :
*********************
./sama   ==> default param file is param.dat
or ./sama paramFileName

To run n times:
***************
./run.sh n
e.g.  ./run.sh 20

Log files:
**********
All logs files are located in directory ./logs/
bestFile-$i.dat, logs the best fitness so far, where $i is the run index (e.g. 20 runs, will output files bestFile-1.dat - bestFile-20.dat.
bestVecFile-$i.dat, logs the best design vector so far.

To get statistic of best fitness after n runs:
***********************************************
./statistic nRun nEvalOfEachRun
where nRun = number of runs, nEvalOfEachRun = number of function evaluations for each run

e.g. ./statistic 20 10000

output of statistic is "statistic.dat"

NB: 
The L-BFGS-B is obtained from an external source, and added into this package with minimum modification.
Please read the license/agreement in using L-BFGS-B in ./temp/lbfgsb.cpp
