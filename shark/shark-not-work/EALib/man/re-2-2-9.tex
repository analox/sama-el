    {istream\&} 
    {is}
    {Input stream from which the data for {\em this} are read.}
    {Reads chromosome data from {\em is} and stores the data in
     {\em this}. The new chromosome is registered. The
     data to be read from {\em is} must have the following
     format:\\
     ``{\tt ChromosomeT$<$}'',\\ 
     {\tt Type of the chromosome},\\ 
     ``{\tt $>$(}'',\\ 
     {\tt Number of alleles},\\
     ``{\tt )}'',\\ 
     {\tt Newline},\\
     {\tt Values for the single alleles, separated by a space or tab
     character}.\\
     For example the data ``{\tt ChromosomeT< int >(5)\\n 1 2 3 4 5}''  
     is written into a file to create a chromosome of type {\tt int}
     with the five alleles 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.}    
    {Pointer to the new chromosome.}
    {This function is not included in this version.}
