In this directory you find the files that are necessary
to create a reference for the package "Rng" in HTML-,
and postscript-format:

For the creation of the reference you need the following
programs:

1. A C++ compiler 
   (Windows: Visual C++)
1. Ghostscript, version 6.0 or higher
   (Windows: A freeware version can be downloaded from
    http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/AFPL/)
2. Ghostview, compatible with the Ghostscript version you use
   (Windows: A freeware version can be downloaded from
    http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/)
3. LaTeX
   (Windows: Use the free MiKTeX package,
    available at http://www.miktex.org/latest.html -
    please install the "Large" version)
4. doxygen, 
   a freeware program that creates the reference
   from special comment commands in the sourcecode.
   Versions for Linux, Windows and other systems
   are available at 
   http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#latestsrc

After the installation please make sure, that your path
variable contains the following pathes:

1. The path of your compiler
   (Windows: Search for the path of Visual C++, that contains
    "cl.exe" and "vcvars32.bat")
2. The "lib" and "bin" directories of Ghostscript
3. The directory of Ghostview, that contains "gsview32.exe"
4. The directory that contains the "latex" executable
5. The "bin" directory of doxygen

If you use Unix, Linux or a compatible system you can
create the reference by typing "make", Windows users
type "makeref".
You can then find a file named "Rng_Reference.html"
in the "doc" directory. This file is the start page for the
HTML-version.
In directory "latex" you will find the file "Rng_Reference.ps",
that contains the postscript-version.
If you also want a pdf-version, change to the
directory path "latex" and type "ps2pdf Rng_Reference.ps Rng_Reference.pdf"
(Unix, Linux and compatible) or open "refman.ps" with
the Ghostview program (Windows), choose "File-->Print"
or "File-->Convert" in the menu, then choose "pdfwrite"
in the scroll list and type "Ok".
