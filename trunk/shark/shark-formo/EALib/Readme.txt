EALib is a C++ library of classes designed for experimentation with evolutionary
algorithms and related techniques. The library also includes example programs which
can be used as templates for own programs to do evolutionary optimization.
The whole package is intended to be used in evolutionary algorithms research.
Therefore, the major emphasis has been put on providing as much flexibility
and extendibility as possible. Efficiency has been considered important as well, but
has been sacrificed where it conflicts with flexibility.
