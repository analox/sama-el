# We suggest experimenting with these parameters.  Suggested things to try
# alpha =1, or alpha = 2
# theta = 1, 10, 100, 500
# n = 10, 50, 100, 1000  (1000 takes a while to run)
# change the ratio of sigma2 to beta2.  Try making beta2 larger

# 
# Notice: Right now the implementation supports comments after each object
# However, it will not handle comments in the middle of objects, i.e.
#
1 0    # this is a bad way to declare beta2
# This is also a bad way to declare beta2.  NO COMMENTS IN THE MIDDLE OF OBJECTS
0 1
#
# Actually, once you've put all the data in the file properly, you don't need to 
comment things anymore.  Thus we can get away with lines like this with no '#'.
