**********    
PARAMETERS
**********

useThisFileFlag	= 1 if want to use setting from this param.dat file
		  0 if want to use default setting from ga.cpp file, i.e. not reading this file 
dimension 	= dimensionality of the problem
popSize 	= population size
maxCount 	= maximum function evaluation count to run
mutateProb 	= mutation probability
memeticProb	= local search probability
memeticIntensity= number of evaluations per local search
evalFunc 	= function name inside the code used for fitness evaluation
		  Eg: griewank, rastrigin, ackley, sphere, bump, elliptic, griewankrosenbrock, rosenbrock, scaffer, step, schwefel102, weierstrass
			schwefel206, schwefel213
sameBoundFlag 	= 1 or true if all dimensions using the same bound, hence need to enter only once in the subsequent parameter below
		  0 or false if not all dimensions using the same bound, hence need to enter as many as dimension bounds below
loBound 	= the low bound ( only one value if sameBoundFlag is 1 , otherwise as many as the dimensionality)
hiBound		= the high bound ( only one value if sameBoundFlag is 1 , otherwise as many as the dimensionality)
rotated		= if rotation matrix is used	
shifted		= if translation vector is used
