    <h1>Array Reference</h1>

    <p>
    The package "Array" provides structures and methods for constructing
    and dealing with arrays. In principle an array can be viewed as an 
    instance of an ordinary C-array, like type <em>item[10][5][3]</em>. 
    However, this is a static instantiation of an array. <BR>
    The arrays in package "Array" are more flexible in that it is possible 
    to dynamically resize or change the number of dimensions. <BR>
    Furthermore, parameter passing by value and
    assignment works properly (i.e., the value is passed or assigned and
    not a pointer to the value) and the subscript operator <em>[ ]</em> may
    perform a range check at run-time (this is implemented by the exception
    mechanism of C++ - see 
    class <a href="./html/classcheck__exception.html">check_exception</a> and file
    <a href="./html/_array_check_8h.html">ArrayCheck.h</a>).

    <h2>Types of Arrays</h2>
    <p>
    There are several classes for different types of arrays in package
    "Array":
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Arrays for any number of dimensions:</b><BR>
            These Arrays can have any number of dimensions with
            arbitrary sizes.<BR>
            Therefore, class <a href="./html/class_array_base.html">ArrayBase</a>
            offers the basic structures and methods and class 
            <a href="./html/class_array.html">Array&lt; T &gt;</a>
            can be used to really create Arrays and deal with them.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>2-dimensional Arrays:</b><BR>
            The classes <a href="./html/class_array2_d.html">Array2D&lt; T &gt;</a> and
            <a href="./html/class_array_table.html">ArrayTable&lt; T &gt;</a> use special
            storage mechanisms to speed up the work with
            2-dimensional arrays.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>3-dimensional Arrays:</b><BR>
            Class <a href="./html/class_array_table.html">ArrayTable&lt; T &gt;</a> also offers
            3-dimensional arrays, that are implemented more efficient
            to speed up the work compared with using the "normal" 
            Array type.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><a href="./html/class_array_index.html">Index Arrays:</a></b><BR>
            These are special one-dimensional Arrays of type <em>unsigned</em>,
            that are used for exchanging data with the programming
            language <em>IDL</em> (<em>I</em>nteractive <em>D</em>ata
            <em>L</em>anguage).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>References to Arrays:</b><BR>
            Sometimes it is more efficient to work with references
            to Arrays to avoid copies of the same Array, wasting
            memory.<BR> 
            There are reference types available for Arrays
            of class <a href="./html/class_array_reference.html">Array&lt; T &gt;</a> and also
            for Arrays of class <a href="./html/class_array2_d_reference.html">Array2D&lt; T &gt;</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Array Operations</h2>
    <p>
    Please notice, that the lists of methods for each operation type are not 
    complete. In many classes of the library "Array" you can find further 
    methods, that are so special, that they couldn't be associated to one 
    of the operation types listed here. This list here will give you a 
    survey only.
